Antonio Palmeros
Interview Project

For this project there were two main things that were needed. The UI component for interactivity and the actual script that runs the algorithm.
I decided to make the app using basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I made the HTML have a basic explanation of what the app does and a dropdown menu
with an input to capture the wanted destination. The CSS was just for some basic formatting to make the UI cleaner and more understandable. Finally,
The JavaScript file is the main script that runs the entire functionality. it runs the  Breadth First Search algorithm to figure out a path from the USA 
to the desired destination. I used Stack Overflow to get me a good idea of how the algorithm should be implemented with JavaScript. I also watched some 
Youtube videos and did some Google searching of the algorithm for some quick review.
